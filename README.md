### Biggest Takeaways:

I enjoyed using `d3.interpolateRainbow` combined with `d3.scaleOrdinal()` to create an array of colors. I wish I could have used `d3.schemeCategory20`, but that's no longer a thing.

I've never worked with anykind of data maps, or hierarchies/leaves. I'll be honest the concepts still confuse me a little bit and I'd like to continue working on them if possible to get a better understanding of how to create them, and how/why they work.
